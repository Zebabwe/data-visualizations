<h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
  Recently, movements and sentiments such as the Black Lives Matter and the issue on police brutality have been gaining traction. While this is not the first time anti-law enforcement sentiments have been spreading amongst the public mainly through social media outlets, it is definitely a very relevant and controversial issue.
  </p>
  
<h2>Insights & Findings</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Total Cases Per State
    </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          California, Texas, and Florida have the highest amount of shooting cases BUT also the 3 most populated states in the US.
        </li>
        <li>
          There’s a general downtrend in the total cases per quarter in the US.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since California is the biggest state, any change can have a big impact on the total number of cases in the US since it holds approximately 12% of the total population.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/us/california-police-records.html">Under a new state law</a>, Ms. Rivera and other members of the public can now request to see the investigative records, prying open for the first time California’s strict secrecy laws regarding police shootings and serious misconduct by officers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://calmatters.org/explainers/california-police-shootings-deadly-force-new-law-explained/">Steps are being taken </a>in order to reduce police shootings using de-escalation tactics, mental health intervention training, carrying more non-lethal tools.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>
      Percentage Availability of Body Cameras
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Approximately <b>88% of cases</b> are not filmed. The lack of body cameras can be one of the causes of recklessness in part of the officers involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite the disparity in the percentage of availability of body cam footage, there is an uptrend in cases being filmed throughout the years, reflecting positive efforts toward standardizing body cameras for the sake of transparency.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Danger Level
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Although majority of shooting cases appear to be warranted (with 61.56% of cases being categorized as Armed and Attacking) we can see a large number of cases where the perpetrator did not show significant threat (202 cases, 4.46%).
      </li>
      <li>
        On paper, it seems that many cases could have been avoided given the number of police shootings inflicted against cases wherein the perpetrator is categorized under "Unarmed and Not Attacking".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Total Cases per Race
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Despite the white population having the highest number of cases, they also have the largest population by race. <i>Anti-BLM apologists cite this data as basis for their argument but it does not consider the proportion of the number of cases to the total population of each race.</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Percentage of Shootings per Race Population per Annum
    </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The percentage of the Black population that are involved in fatal police shootings are consistently higher throughout the years while white cases have one of the lowest percentages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Given this, the Black population is more likely to be fatally shot by police compared to any other race.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
<h2>Our Recommendations</h2>
<p>State law enforcement could follow suit with California in terms of enacted policies and training in appropriate use of force to avoid unnecessary deaths. Given the proportional trend between the decrease in fatal police shootings and the increase in body camera adoption, following up on the mass adoption of body cameras would allow for more transparency with police interactions.</p>
